#Artificial Intelligence Class Project
The necessary Python Libraries needed to run this program are ScikitLearn and pandas.

To run this program, go into an editor and copy the path of the "train" excel file inside the folder and past it onto where df = plane.read_csv(r'PASTE HERE'). Remove the quotation marks and leave the apostrophes.

Save the File.

Run the program from the folder by double clicking it within the folder.

You will then be presented with the metrics of measurement for the model as it will have both created the model and run its own test against it as well as runtime.

Follow the steps displayed on the screen as accurately as possible. Failure to do so will cause the program to be unable to run a proper prediction and it may crash. 

At the end, the program will display a prediction about how the simulated consumer would feel about the flight with the specified inputs.

Then, you can click 'retry' to run another prediction or 'exit' to close the program.
